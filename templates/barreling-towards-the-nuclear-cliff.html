              <p>When it was finally announced that Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant in Westchester County, NY <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/deal-reached-shut-indian-point-nuclear-power-plant-2021-article-1.2937714"target="_blank">plans to shut its doors</a> in 2021, the surrounding towns breathed a sigh of relief.&nbsp; The plant&rsquo;s two remaining generators have operated nearly continuously since they were commissioned in the mid-70&rsquo;s, but have <a href="http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2012/03/05/indian-point-safe-secure-and-vital-or-an-unacceptable-risk/"target="_blank">come under fire</a> in recent years for not meeting modern safety standards.&nbsp; New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and others have pushed for years to close the plant, which sits less than 30 miles from New York City, fearing the potential danger of allowing the plant to continue operating in such close proximity to the largest urban area in the nation.&nbsp; The planned retirement at Indian Point follows a slowly building trend taking place across the country.&nbsp; The odd one out in the battle between environmentalists and oil tycoons, nuclear power has struggled to find many supporters and risks fading entirely without some serious shake-ups.</p>
              <p>Nuclear power is no longer the golden child that it once was.&nbsp; Back in the &lsquo;70s and &lsquo;80s nuclear plants were flying up around the country as harnessing the power of the atom was seen as a source of national pride.&nbsp; Optimism for this new mega source of power soared so high that one U.S. automaker even investigated <a href="https://www.damninteresting.com/the-atomic-automobile/"target="_blank">putting a reactor in a car</a>.</p>

              <p>However, this frenzy did not last forever; support for nuclear energy dropped dramatically after system failures occurred at a handful of reactors around the world.&nbsp; Namely, the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in Pennsylvania in 1979 sent shockwaves through the nuclear power industry in the United States.&nbsp; While consensus still has not been reached on the extent to which this incident effected the surrounding population, a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1241392/"target="_blank">2003 study</a> found no link between mortality rates in the surrounding towns and leaked radiation.&nbsp; Nonetheless, from a public opinion point of view the Three Mile Island accident was deadly for the industry.&nbsp; While a large number of plants were already in the works at the time of the incident, construction of new plants dropped immediately; in 2012 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nuclear-license-idUSTRE8181T420120209"target="_blank">issued an operating license</a> for the first time since Three Mile Island.</p>
              <p>Despite the rapid drop-off in construction, nuclear energy still makes up a huge portion of the modern electrical grid.&nbsp; Today, nuclear power contributes to 20% of the total electricity production in the United States.&nbsp; That is more than all other clean energy sources combined.</p>

              <p>For decades, this massive source of carbon-free electricity has been a rock in US power production.&nbsp; Once built, nuclear plants are models of consistency, running around the clock for years until they are eventually decommissioned at the end of their roughly 40-year lifetime.&nbsp; While the United States has been able to lean on this power source without question since the &lsquo;80s, the fact remains that the plants do not last forever and we may be on the verge of a massive extinction.</p>
              <p>The typical rule of thumb for nuclear plants assumes most reactors will operate for about 40 years with the potential to tack on another 20 at the end by completing an &lsquo;uprate&rsquo; process and applying for a permit extension.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these uprates are generally expensive and the permitting process is complicated and can take years to navigate.&nbsp; Thus, the next 20-30 years could see a collapse in nuclear power generation in the US.</p>

              <p>The above graph tracks how nuclear energy production could fall based on several planned closures in the coming years and the expiration of aging permits down the road.&nbsp; If the NRC continues its policy of withholding nuclear permits, this picture could become reality.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Even leaving the issue of permitting aside, nuclear power faces an even more imminent threat: basic economics.&nbsp; The energy grid in the United States today is actually not a national system, but a fragmented one based on three major regions.&nbsp; The result of this is that nuclear power generated on the east coast for example will be consumed on the east coast regardless of local demand.&nbsp; Most power sources deal with this restriction by varying production based on the current energy needs, but nuclear does not have this luxury; the plants must always be running.&nbsp; Ultimately, this means that nuclear plants often are forced to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-05/one-thing-california-texas-have-in-common-is-negative-power"target="_blank">produce electricity at a loss</a>.&nbsp; Nuclear facilities are not evenly distributed around the country, so many markets end up saturated with nuclear generated electricity while others are left relying on other sources for power.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>With plants such as Pilgrim I in Plymouth, MA already announcing planned closures for economic reasons, the need for fast action could not be higher. &nbsp;Once the lengthy decommissioning process has begun, a plant cannot be reopened; there are not Brett Farves in the world of nuclear energy.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>The solution to the impending crisis must be twofold; in order to prevent a sudden collapse, construction ought to begin immediately on new plants with federal aid to offset the current economic conditions for nuclear power.&nbsp; Secondly, and more long term, the US needs to rethink the structure of its energy grid, which is built specifically to benefit the old system of fossil fuels.&nbsp; A number of groups have already investigated ways to <a href="http://acadiacenter.org/initiative/energygrid/"target="_blank">restructure</a> the grid and level the playing field so that clean, carbon-free electricity can compete fairly with fossil fuels.&nbsp; Without serious adjustments, one of the central players in the US energy system could soon fade entirely.</p>
